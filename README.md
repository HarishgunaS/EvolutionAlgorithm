# EvolutionAlgorithm
A simple evolutionary algorithm that takes a predefined perfect specimen, then randomly generates a population of individuals. Each generation, individuals that are genetically inferior die off. Genetically superior individuals reproduce to refill the population. When the average fitness of the population reaches a certain threshold, the program ends.
